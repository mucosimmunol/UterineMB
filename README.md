Uterine microbiota plasticity during the menstrual cycle: differences between healthy controls and patients with recurrent miscarriage or implantation failure 

This repository contains raw data and scripts from the Uterine microbiome project by Vomstein K, Reider S, ..., Moschen AR and Toth B currently being prepared for submission.
The project analysed endometrial fluid from 20 patients with repeated miscarriage, 20 patients with repeated implantation failure and 10 healthy controls using 16S amplicon based sequencing during the course of the menstrual cycle.
